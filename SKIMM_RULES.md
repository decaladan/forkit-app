# The Rules of Skimm

*The definitive style guide for writing skimms. Like a haiku — strict rules that create beauty through constraint.*

---

## 1. The Skim Stack: Structure

Every skimm has exactly three parts, in this order: **Hook, Core, Snap**.

No exceptions. No fourth section. No preamble. No "intro before the intro."

---

## 2. Word Limits

**Total: 150 words max. Sweet spot: 100-130 words.**

| Section | Sweet Spot | Hard Limit |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| Hook    | 8-15 words | 20 max |
| Core    | 60-90 words | 100 max |
| Snap    | 8-18 words | 25 max |

**Creation UI word count indicator:**
- 80-110 words: green ("Tight and punchy")
- 110-130 words: neutral
- 130-150 words: yellow ("Consider trimming")
- 150+ words: hard stop (rejected)

**Why 150:** At 300 WPM in RSVP mode, 150 words = 30 seconds. That's within the "15-45 seconds to consume" product target. STEM topics naturally run 107-124 words. Narrative topics (history, culture, psychology) need 125-150 to carry enough context. The sweet spot nudge guides creators toward brevity without making complex topics impossible.

---

## 3. Hook Rules

**Purpose:** Create a gap between what the reader knows and what they're about to learn.

**Format:** One or two sentences. Never more.

**Can be:**
- A question: "Why can't you tickle yourself?"
- A surprising claim: "Your brain uses 20% of your energy but is 2% of your body weight."
- A contradiction: "The sky isn't actually blue."
- A two-part punch (claim + reframe): "Procrastination isn't laziness. It's your brain choosing comfort now over reward later."

**Rules:**
- Max 20 words total (across one or two sentences).
- Must be answerable or addressable by the Core that follows.
- No clickbait. The Core must genuinely deliver on the Hook's promise.
- Must stand alone. If someone reads ONLY the Hook, they should feel curiosity.
- Questions are strongest. Use them 60%+ of the time.

**Banned openers:**
- "Did you know...?" — lazy and patronizing.
- "Ever wonder why...?" — equally lazy.
- "Let's talk about..." — no curiosity gap.
- "In this skim..." — essay introduction, not a hook.
- "What if I told you..." — cliche Matrix reference.

**Good Hooks:**
- "Why does hot water freeze faster than cold water?" *(question, surprising, specific)*
- "A rock the size of a city ended 165 million years of dinosaur dominance in a single afternoon." *(vivid, specific, creates urgency)*
- "In some elections, politicians choose their voters before voters choose their politicians." *(chiasmus, structural surprise)*
- "Evolution isn't about survival of the fittest — it's about survival of the good-enough." *(reframe of misconception)*

**Bad Hooks:**
- "Let's talk about black holes." *(no curiosity gap)*
- "Did you know that the human body has 206 bones?" *(lazy format, trivia card energy)*
- "What is the most interesting thing about quantum physics?" *(vague, unanswerable in 100 words)*

---

## 4. Core Rules

**Purpose:** Deliver the explanation. This is the learning payload.

**Format:** 3-6 sentences. Plain language throughout.

**Rules:**
- Max 100 words. Sweet spot: 60-90.
- Reading level: Flesch-Kincaid Grade 6-8 ("smart 14-year-old").
- **Max 20 words per sentence.** No exceptions in the Core. (In RSVP at 300 WPM, a 20-word sentence takes 4 seconds. That's the upper limit before readers lose the thread.)
- One analogy or concrete comparison strongly encouraged. Not mandatory for simple topics, but most skimms benefit from one. The analogy must clarify, not decorate.
- No jargon without immediate, inline definition. "Entropy (the tendency of things to become disordered)" — not "entropy" alone. If the term is named but not explained, either add a gloss or drop the name.
- **Max one parenthetical per Core.** Parentheticals break RSVP flow. If you need two, restructure one into its own sentence.
- Each sentence must advance the explanation. No filler. No throat-clearing.
- Use active voice. "Darwin proposed evolution" not "Evolution was proposed by Darwin."
- Numbers: use digits, not words. "60%" not "sixty percent." Exception: "one" and "two" when not being precise.
- Present tense default. "Your brain uses..." not "Your brain will use..."

**Banned filler phrases:**
- "Interestingly,", "In fact,", "As it turns out," — delete and start with the actual point.
- "It's worth noting that..." — if it's worth noting, just note it.
- "Scientists have discovered that..." — just state the discovery.
- "Actually" and "literally" — add nothing.

**Good Core** *(from "Why is the ocean salty?"):*
> Rivers dissolve tiny amounts of salt from rocks and carry it to the sea. The ocean has been collecting this salt for billions of years. Water evaporates back into clouds, but the salt stays behind. Think of it like a pot on the stove. As water boils off, whatever's dissolved gets more concentrated. The ocean never gives it back.

**Bad Core:**
> The salinity of ocean water, which has been extensively studied by oceanographers and marine scientists around the world, can be attributed to a complex geochemical process involving the dissolution of mineral salts from terrestrial rock formations...

*(No. Just no.)*

---

## 5. Snap Rules

**Purpose:** The mic-drop. The line that sticks in your head. The thing you tell someone at dinner.

**Format:** One or two short sentences.

**Rules:**
- Max 25 words. Sweet spot: 8-18.
- Must be quotable on its own. If someone reads ONLY the Snap, it should be interesting.
- Reframes or elevates the Core. Not a summary — a new angle.
- Emotional resonance: wonder, humor, awe, surprise, gravity, irony. Pick one.
- Can break slightly from the explanatory tone. This is where personality lives.
- Em-dashes ARE allowed in Snaps (they display as complete lines in all reading modes).

**Banned patterns:**
- "So next time you..." — cliche wrapper.
- "In other words..." — that's a summary, not a snap.
- "And that's how X works." — dead ending.
- "This is a fascinating area of ongoing research." — textbook sign-off.
- "We should all think about..." — preachy.

**Good Snaps:**
- "Hiccups are a 370-million-year-old fish reflex. Your body kept the code and forgot to delete it." *(tech metaphor applied to biology, quotable)*
- "Inflation isn't prices going up. It's your money going down." *(simple reframe, perfect)*
- "Deja vu isn't a window into the past. It's your brain accidentally hitting 'save' twice." *(tech metaphor, memorable)*
- "Vaccines are cheat codes — they let your immune system study the answers before the test." *(gaming metaphor, shareable)*
- "We know Earth's age because space rocks kept a better diary than our own planet did." *(personification, charming)*
- "The real wonder of the pyramids isn't the stones. It's the logistics." *(reframe from spectacle to system)*

**Bad Snaps:**
- "And that's how black holes work." *(dead ending, no reframe)*
- "So next time you look at the ocean, remember it's salty because of rivers." *(cliche wrapper, just restates the Core)*
- "This is a fascinating area of ongoing research." *(textbook sign-off)*

## 6. Tone Rules

**The voice:** A brilliant friend explaining something at a bar. Confident, not cocky. Playful, not silly. Simple, not dumbed-down.

**DO:**
- Use contractions ("it's", "you're", "don't").
- Address the reader as "you."
- Use concrete images over abstract concepts.
- Be direct. Start sentences with the subject.
- Use humor when it serves the explanation, never as decoration.
- Write like you talk (then edit it tighter).
- Be confident. State things. "The Earth is 4.54 billion years old" — not "The Earth is believed to be..."

**DON'T:**
- Use exclamation marks. They try too hard. (Only exception: inside a direct quote if historically accurate.)
- Use hedging language ("sort of", "kind of", "it seems like", "perhaps") — be confident.
- Say "scientists say" or "experts believe" — just state the thing.
- Be cute or quirky at the expense of clarity.
- Use rhetorical "right?" — it's condescending.
- Open with "So," — it's a verbal tic, not a sentence starter.
- Write anything you wouldn't say out loud to a friend.

## 7. RSVP Compatibility Rules

In Speed Mode, users see ONE word at a time at 300 WPM. These rules ensure skimms work in that mode.

- **No em-dashes (—) in the Core.** The dash appears as its own "word" flash and disorients readers. Use periods to split sentences instead. Em-dashes are allowed in Hooks and Snaps, which display as complete lines.
- **No sentences over 20 words in the Core.** At 300 WPM, a 20-word sentence takes 4 seconds. That's the limit before readers lose the thread of what the sentence was about.
- **No ellipses (...) as prose punctuation.** They stall momentum in RSVP. Exception: mathematical notation ("0.999...", "1, 2, 3...") is exempt. These are notation, not stylistic pauses.
- **No long subordinate clauses.** Bad: "The theory, which Darwin first proposed after his voyage on the Beagle in 1831, suggests that..." Good: "Darwin proposed this after sailing on the Beagle in 1831."
- **Key terms should work as standalone words.** "CRISPR" reads fine as a single flash. Avoid constructing long compound phrases that only make sense as a group.
- **Avoid words over 12 characters when a shorter synonym exists.** The RSVP engine slows for long words. Too many long words in a row kills rhythm. ("Thermoregulation" is fine if necessary, but don't use "conceptualization" when "idea" works.)
- **Avoid hyphenated compounds over 3 words.** "13.8-billion-year-old" is either one enormous token or breaks confusingly at hyphens. Restructure: "The universe is 13.8 billion years old" flashes cleanly word by word.
- **Use compact number notation.** Digits are RSVP-friendly: "60%" is one flash, "sixty percent" is two. Large numbers: "4.54 billion" (two clean tokens) not "4,540,000,000" (one unwieldy token). Short math notation like "12/0 = x" flashes as a single readable token.
- **Every word must earn its place.** In RSVP, filler words waste the reader's most precious resource: attention during a one-word flash.

---

## 8. Subtitle Compatibility Rules

In Subtitle Mode, text appears in 2-5 word phrase chunks. Writing must break naturally into these chunks.

- **Write in short, declarative phrases.** "Rivers carry salt / to the ocean. / The salt stays behind / when water evaporates."
- **Break before conjunctions and prepositions.** The chunking algorithm breaks before "but", "and", "in", "for", "with". Write sentences that break naturally at these points.
- **Keep quoted phrases under 5 words.** Quoted text stays together in subtitle display.
- **Avoid nested clauses.** One subject, one verb, one object per sentence where possible.
- **Front-load meaning.** Put the important word early in the sentence. "Salt accumulates" not "What accumulates is salt."
- **Sentences that break cleanly into subtitle chunks also read better in every other mode.** This isn't an extra constraint — it's what "plain language" already implies.

---

## 9. One Concept, Always

**Every skimm explains exactly one concept.** This is non-negotiable.

- If a concept needs a prerequisite, link to it. Don't explain two things in one skimm.
- "What is inflation?" is one concept. "What is inflation and how do central banks control it?" is two.
- The test: can you state what this skimm teaches in 5 words or fewer? If not, it's covering too much.

---

## 10. What a Skimm Is NOT

A skimm is NOT:

- **A Wikipedia intro.** No encyclopedic tone, no exhaustive coverage. You explain one thing, not everything.
- **A listicle.** No "5 things about..." or "Here are three reasons..." The Core is prose, not bullets.
- **A hot take.** No opinion, no argument, no persuasion. Skimms explain, they don't convince.
- **A teaser.** The Core must fully deliver on the Hook. No "but that's a story for another time."
- **A textbook paragraph.** No passive voice walls, no jargon dumps, no citations.
- **A tweet thread.** Not fragmented thoughts. The three sections form one cohesive explanation.
- **A trivia card.** Not just a fun fact. There must be an explanation of WHY or HOW, not just WHAT.
- **An essay introduction.** No "In this skim, we'll explore..." Just start.
- **Preachy.** No moral lessons, no "we should all..." endings. Inform, don't instruct.
- **Condescending.** No "It's actually quite simple" or "This might sound complicated, but..." Just explain it.

## 11. The Skimm Checklist (Quality Gate)

Before publishing, every skimm must pass all of these:

- [ ] Hook creates genuine curiosity?
- [ ] Core delivers on the Hook's promise?
- [ ] Snap is quotable on its own?
- [ ] Total under 150 words?
- [ ] No sentence over 20 words in the Core?
- [ ] No em-dashes in the Core?
- [ ] Max one parenthetical in the Core?
- [ ] No jargon without inline definition?
- [ ] One concept only — can you state the lesson in 5 words?
- [ ] Would you send this to a friend?
- [ ] Read it word-by-word aloud — does every word earn its place?
- [ ] Read it in 3-5 word chunks — does it break naturally?

## 12. Gold Standard Examples

These skimms from the launch set exemplify every rule above.

**Best STEM skimm — "Why Can't We Divide by Zero?" (numbers-001):**
> **Hook:** Dividing by zero doesn't give you infinity. It breaks math itself.
>
> **Core:** Division asks: how many times does this number fit into that one? 12 divided by 3 means "how many 3s fit into 12?" Four. Now try 12 divided by zero: how many 0s fit into 12? You can add zero forever and never reach 12. There's no answer. It gets worse. If 12/0 = x, then x times 0 should equal 12. But anything times zero is zero. No number works. Allowing division by zero would create contradictions that unravel the entire number system.
>
> **Snap:** We don't ban dividing by zero to be difficult. We ban it because allowing it would destroy every other rule in math.

*Why it works: Hook escalates from "not infinity" to "breaks math." Core walks through two proofs in plain language. Snap reframes from "arbitrary rule" to "structural necessity."*

**Best culture skimm — "Why Do We Procrastinate?" (mind-005):**
> **Hook:** Procrastination isn't laziness. It's your brain choosing comfort now over reward later.
>
> **Core:** Your brain has two competing systems. The limbic system wants immediate pleasure and runs on autopilot. The prefrontal cortex handles planning and long-term thinking, but it requires effort to engage. When a task feels boring, difficult, or unclear, the limbic system wins. Procrastination is actually an emotional regulation problem, not a time management one. People delay tasks that trigger anxiety, boredom, or fear of failure. The task itself isn't the issue. The feeling it creates is.
>
> **Snap:** You don't procrastinate because you're lazy. You procrastinate because the task makes you feel something you'd rather avoid.

*Why it works: Hook reframes a common misconception in two punchy sentences. Core delivers a genuine insight (emotional regulation, not time management). Snap personalizes with "you" and lands the reframe.*

*These rules are the style guide. Every creator, every AI prompt, every editorial review uses this document as the standard. When in doubt, read your skimm word by word at 300 WPM. If it flows, it's right. If it stumbles, rewrite.*
