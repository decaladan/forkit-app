# The Rules of ForkIt

*The definitive style guide for ForkIt recipes. Like a food fight — controlled chaos that produces something delicious.*

---

## 1. The Recipe Stack: Structure

Every ForkIt invention has exactly eight parts, in this order: **Dish Name, Tagline, Debate Summary, Ingredients, Steps, Stats, Smart Swaps, Snap**.

No exceptions. No ninth section. No "About This Recipe" preamble. No food-blogger backstory about your grandmother. No nutrition panel. Just the stack.

The Recipe Stack is the skeleton. The chef personalities are the meat. Strip either one and the recipe dies.

---

## 2. Limits & Constraints

**Recipes must be cookable by a real human in a real kitchen with real groceries.**

| Section         | Sweet Spot      | Hard Limit        |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Dish Name       | 3-5 words       | 6 words max       |
| Tagline         | 8-12 words      | 15 words max      |
| Debate Summary  | 30-40 words     | 50 words max      |
| Ingredients     | 6-10 items      | 12 items max      |
| Steps           | 4-6 steps       | 8 steps max       |
| Step sentence   | 10-15 words     | 20 words max      |
| Smart Swaps     | exactly 2-3     | 3 max             |
| Snap            | 8-15 words      | 20 words max      |

**Total time constraint: recipes should take 30 minutes or less.** ForkIt answers "what do I eat RIGHT NOW?" not "what should I meal prep on Sunday?" If a recipe needs 4 hours of braising, it doesn't belong here.

**Why these limits:** Every constraint serves accessibility. Max 12 ingredients because a grocery run with 20 items kills motivation. Max 8 steps because step 9 is when someone orders DoorDash. Max 6-word dish name because it needs to fit on a card, in a share preview, and in a text message to your friend saying "you have to try this."

**Creation UI indicators:**
- Ingredients 6-10: green ("Clean and doable")
- Ingredients 10-12: yellow ("Getting heavy")
- Ingredients 12+: hard stop (rejected)
- Steps 4-6: green ("Tight and fast")
- Steps 6-8: yellow ("Consider simplifying")
- Steps 8+: hard stop (rejected)
- Total time under 20 min: green ("Speed Demon approved")
- Total time 20-30 min: neutral
- Total time 30+: rejected

---

## 3. Dish Name Rules

**Purpose:** The hook. The thing that makes someone stop scrolling and say "wait, WHAT?" The Dish Name is the entire personality compressed into a handful of words.

**Format:** One phrase. Max 6 words. Must function as both a title and a joke.

**Can be:**
- A character description: "The Regret-Free Nacho Mountain"
- An absurd scenario: "Panic Pasta alla Whatever"
- A budget brag: "Budget King's $2 Feast"
- A speed flex: "Five-Minute Flavor Emergency"
- A contradiction: "Healthy Junk Food Paradox Bowl"

**Rules:**
- Max 6 words. No exceptions.
- Must describe the actual food. A name that could mean anything fails. "The Chaos" tells you nothing. "Chaos Ramen" tells you everything.
- Should make someone laugh, double-take, or screenshot.
- Each name should feel like it was invented in a chaotic kitchen at midnight by five chefs who can't agree on anything.
- Capitalize every major word (title case).
- No hashtags, no emojis, no special characters beyond hyphens and apostrophes.
- Must be original. No real restaurant dish names, no copyrighted brand references.

**Banned patterns:**
- Single-word names — "Fusion" means nothing. Try harder.
- Generic descriptions — "Chicken with Rice" is a search result, not a ForkIt invention.
- Numbered names — "Recipe #47" has the energy of a lab experiment.
- Health-first framing — "Nutritious Power Bowl" sounds like a hospital cafeteria.
- Pun-only names — "Lettuce Celebrate" is a pun, not a personality. Puns are allowed if the name ALSO describes the dish.
- Names that require explanation — if you have to explain the joke, the name failed.

**Good Dish Names:**
- "The Regret-Free Nacho Mountain" *(descriptive, funny, implies indulgence without guilt)*
- "Panic Pasta alla Whatever" *(captures the vibe, tells you it's pasta, implies improvisation)*
- "Budget King's $2 Feast" *(chef personality bleeds through, specific, intriguing)*
- "Midnight Quesadilla of Shame" *(vivid, emotional, relatable, you know exactly what this is)*
- "Emergency Fried Rice Protocol" *(urgent, funny, specific food)*

**Bad Dish Names:**
- "Chicken with Rice" *(no personality, no curiosity, no reason to click)*
- "Healthy Salad Bowl" *(reads like a stock photo caption)*
- "Recipe #47" *(lab specimen energy)*
- "Yummy Delicious Treat" *(means nothing, describes nothing)*
- "The Ultimate Mega Supreme" *(what food is this? Nobody knows)*

---

## 4. Tagline Rules

**Purpose:** The one-liner that sells the dish. If the Dish Name is the hook, the Tagline is the personality statement. It tells you which chef won and what kind of energy this recipe carries.

**Format:** One sentence. Max 15 words.

**Can be:**
- A chef victory lap: "Maximum Junk went full send and nobody stopped him."
- A compromise summary: "Gut Fix and Speed Demon finally agreed on something. Barely."
- A dare: "Budget King says you can't make this for more than $4. Try."
- A vibe: "Max Flavour brought the heat and the kitchen hasn't recovered."
- A confession: "This started as a dare and ended as dinner."

**Rules:**
- One sentence only. Not two. Not a sentence and a fragment.
- Max 15 words.
- Must capture the dish's personality — reading the tagline should give you the dish's energy.
- Should reference the winning chef's philosophy, either directly by name or through voice.
- Use contractions. "Maximum Junk went full send" not "Maximum Junk decided to go full send."
- No periods inside the tagline. One sentence, one terminal punctuation mark.

**Banned patterns:**
- "A delicious and nutritious..." — marketing copy from 2003.
- "The perfect meal for..." — meal-kit brochure energy.
- "You'll love this..." — presumptuous. Let the recipe prove it.
- "Healthy, quick, and easy!" — exclamation mark AND three adjectives. Crimes.
- Any sentence starting with "This recipe..." — it's a tagline, not a product description.

**Good Taglines:**
- "Maximum Junk went full send and nobody stopped him." *(specific chef, specific energy, implies glorious excess)*
- "Gut Fix compromised, but the kimchi was non-negotiable." *(character conflict, specific ingredient tease)*
- "Budget King built a throne out of rice and beans." *(metaphor, budget philosophy, tells you the base ingredients)*
- "Speed Demon made this in 8 minutes and it has no right being this good." *(time flex, surprise quality)*
- "Max Flavour brought three kinds of heat. Gut Fix brought the antacids." *(two chefs, personality clash, humor)*

**Bad Taglines:**
- "A delicious and nutritious meal for the whole family." *(dead, generic, sounds like a frozen dinner box)*
- "This recipe is quick and easy to make." *(no personality, no chef, no hook)*
- "A wonderful blend of flavors and textures." *(restaurant menu description, says nothing)*
- "Everyone will enjoy this tasty dish." *(who is everyone? What dish? This is nothing.)*

---

## 5. Debate Summary Rules

**Purpose:** The narrative engine. This is where ForkIt's core conceit lives — five AI chef personalities debating what to cook. The Debate Summary is a 2-3 sentence recap of that argument. It's the worldbuilding.

**Format:** 2-3 sentences. Max 50 words.

**Rules:**
- Must reference at least 2 chefs by name.
- Must explain WHY this dish won the debate. What argument was most compelling? What compromise was struck?
- Must show personality clash. If all chefs agree, there's no debate, and no story.
- Present tense preferred. "Gut Fix wants a salad" reads more alive than "Gut Fix wanted a salad."
- Each chef named must do or say something specific. "Budget King approved" is fine. "Budget King was involved" is nothing.
- 50 words max. This is a recap, not a transcript.

**The Five Chefs (voice reference):**

| Chef           | Philosophy              | Voice Signature                                 |
|----------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Max Flavour    | Bold, complex, layered  | Aggressive, uses "blast", "fire", "bold", "hit" |
| Maximum Junk   | Comfort, indulgence     | Gleeful, unapologetic, cheese-obsessed          |
| Gut Fix        | Gut health, fermented   | Gentle but firm, slightly preachy, loveable      |
| Budget King    | Cheap, resourceful      | Practical, proud of savings, cites dollar amounts|
| Speed Demon    | Fast, minimal effort    | Impatient, time references, hates complexity     |

**Rules for chef references:**
- Use their full name on first mention. Shortened forms ("Budget" alone, "Max" alone) are allowed ONLY if context makes it unambiguous.
- Each named chef must contribute a specific action or stance. Don't just list who was "present."
- The winning argument should feel logical even though it's absurd. "Maximum Junk argued that queso solves everything. No one could disprove it." has an internal logic.

**Good Debate Summaries:**
- "Gut Fix wanted a salad. Maximum Junk wanted nachos. They compromised: nachos with fermented kimchi and probiotic sour cream. Budget King approved the price tag." *(two chefs named with positions, compromise is specific, third chef validates)*
- "Speed Demon vetoed anything over 10 minutes. Max Flavour refused to sacrifice the sear. They met at stir-fry: high heat, fast cook, maximum flavor." *(time constraint vs. quality constraint, resolution is specific)*
- "Budget King pitched rice and beans. Maximum Junk demanded cheese. The result: loaded cheesy rice that costs less than a coffee. Gut Fix added hot sauce for digestion and called it health food." *(escalating compromise, each chef adds a layer)*

**Bad Debate Summaries:**
- "The chefs discussed various options and decided on this recipe." *(no names, no conflict, no personality, no story)*
- "Everyone agreed that tacos would be great." *(no debate = no point. The whole conceit is conflict.)*
- "Max Flavour and Budget King both had ideas and after some discussion they came to an agreement." *(what ideas? What agreement? This says nothing.)*
- "This recipe was created through a collaborative process." *(corporate meeting minutes energy. Absolutely not.)*

---

## 6. Ingredient Rules

**Purpose:** The recipe must be cookable. Ingredients are where ambition meets reality. The ingredient list is the contract between the recipe and the person standing in their kitchen at 9 PM.

**Format:** Bulleted list. Each item: quantity + unit + ingredient name. Group by category only if over 8 ingredients.

**Rules:**
- Max 12 ingredients. Sweet spot: 6-10.
- Every ingredient must include a quantity and a unit. "Salt" alone is not an ingredient line. "1 tsp salt" is.
- Use common, accessible ingredients. The default assumption is a regular grocery store, not a specialty market. Exception: if a chef's personality demands something specific (Max Flavour's smoked paprika, Gut Fix's kimchi), one or two specialty items are allowed, but they must appear in Smart Swaps.
- No brand names. "Hot sauce" not "Cholula." "Sandwich bread" not "Wonder Bread."
- Use standard measurements: tsp, tbsp, cup, oz, lb, cloves, slices, pinch.
- List ingredients in order of use. The first ingredient listed should be the first one the cook reaches for.
- When an ingredient needs prep, include it inline: "1 chicken breast, diced" not just "1 chicken breast."
- Group by category (Base, Sauce, Topping, etc.) only when over 8 ingredients. Under 8, a flat list is cleaner.

**Banned ingredient patterns:**
- "Season to taste" as an ingredient — that's a step instruction, not an ingredient.
- "Assorted vegetables" — name the vegetables. Be specific.
- "Your favorite cheese" — pick one. That's the chef's job.
- Ingredients with no quantity — every item gets a number.
- Rare ingredients without a Smart Swap — if it's hard to find, the recipe needs an alternative.

**Good Ingredient List:**
```
- 2 cups cooked rice (day-old is best)
- 2 eggs
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp sesame oil
- 1 cup frozen peas and carrots
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 green onions, sliced
- 1 tsp chili flakes
```
*(Ordered by use, specific quantities, prep instructions inline, common ingredients, clean and scannable.)*

**Bad Ingredient List:**
```
- Rice
- Some eggs
- Soy sauce
- Oil
- Vegetables
- Garlic
- Onions
- Spices
```
*(No quantities, vague items, "vegetables" and "spices" are not ingredients, "some eggs" is not a measurement.)*

---

## 7. Step Rules

**Purpose:** Turn ingredients into food. Each step is one action. If someone can't follow your steps while slightly panicked and slightly hungry, they're too complicated.

**Format:** Numbered list. Each step: one action, one sentence, max 20 words.

**Rules:**
- Max 8 steps. Sweet spot: 4-6.
- One action per step. "Dice the onion and sear the chicken" is two steps crammed into one. Split them.
- Max 20 words per step. At a glance, on a phone, while stirring something — that's the reading context.
- Use active voice, imperative mood. "Toss the chicken in the pan" not "The chicken should be placed in a heated pan."
- Include sensory cues. "Cook until golden brown" tells you what to look for. "Cook for a while" tells you nothing.
- Include time estimates where relevant. "Sear 3 minutes per side" is better than "sear until done."
- First step should be the most immediate action. Don't start with "preheat the oven" if the first 4 steps are stovetop.
- Final step should be plating or assembly, not cleanup.
- No sub-steps. If a step needs sub-steps, it's too complex. Break it up.
- No commentary inside steps. "Toss the garlic in — this is where the magic happens!" is a blog post, not a step.

**Banned step patterns:**
- "Set aside" as its own step — it's a transition, not an action. Fold it into the previous step.
- "Optional: add..." — nothing is optional. The chefs debated this. Commit.
- Steps with no verb — "Salt and pepper" is not a step. "Season with salt and pepper" is.
- Passive voice — "The mixture should be stirred" is dead. "Stir the mixture" is alive.
- Steps longer than 20 words — if you can't say it in 20 words, you're combining actions.

**Good Steps:**
```
1. Heat sesame oil in a large pan over high heat.
2. Scramble eggs in the pan, break into small pieces, set aside.
3. Add garlic to the same pan, cook 30 seconds until fragrant.
4. Toss in rice, soy sauce, and frozen veggies. Stir-fry 4 minutes.
5. Return eggs to pan, add chili flakes and green onions.
6. Serve immediately. Eat standing up if Speed Demon wins the vote.
```
*(Each step is one action, sensory cues present, time estimates included, imperative mood, personality in the final step.)*

**Bad Steps:**
```
1. First, you'll want to get your pan nice and hot, and while that's heating up, go ahead and crack your eggs into a bowl and whisk them together with a fork until they're nice and fluffy.
2. Pour the eggs into the pan.
3. Add stuff.
4. Cook until done.
```
*(Step 1 is a paragraph. Step 3 is meaningless. Step 4 has no sensory cue. "You'll want to" is passive blog-speak.)*

---

## 8. Stats Rules

**Purpose:** The at-a-glance numbers. Before someone commits to a recipe, they check the stats. These must be honest, precise, and formatted consistently.

**Format:** Structured data block with exactly these fields.

**Required fields:**

| Stat             | Format                        | Rules                                         |
|------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Prep Time        | X min                         | Always in minutes. No "5-10 min" ranges.      |
| Cook Time        | X min                         | Always in minutes. "0 min" if no-cook recipe. |
| Total Time       | X min                         | Must equal Prep + Cook. Shown prominently.     |
| Servings         | 1-4                           | ForkIt is "what do I eat NOW." Max 4.          |
| Difficulty       | Easy / Medium / Adventurous   | Three tiers only. Not "Hard" — "Adventurous." |
| Estimated Cost   | $ / $$ / $$$                  | Per serving. Based on average grocery prices.  |

**Rules:**
- Total Time must be the arithmetic sum of Prep Time and Cook Time. No rounding, no fudging.
- Servings range is 1-4. ForkIt doesn't do dinner parties. If a recipe naturally makes 6 servings, scale it down or note "makes 4 with leftovers."
- Difficulty tiers:
  - **Easy:** One pan, no technique required, a college freshman could do it.
  - **Medium:** Some technique (searing, reducing, timing multiple components), but nothing scary.
  - **Adventurous:** Requires actual skill or unusual technique (tempering chocolate, making a roux, deep frying). Not "hard" — "adventurous." The framing matters.
- Cost tiers:
  - **$:** Under $3 per serving. Budget King territory.
  - **$$:** $3-7 per serving. Most recipes land here.
  - **$$$:** Over $7 per serving. Max Flavour splurge territory.
- No "N/A" for any field. Every recipe has every stat.
- Time values must be honest. Don't claim "5 min prep" if the recipe requires dicing three vegetables and marinating.

**Banned stat patterns:**
- "Varies" — commit to a number.
- "15-20 min" ranges — pick one. If it depends, pick the higher number.
- "Serves 6-8" — this isn't Thanksgiving. Scale it down.
- Omitting Total Time — it's the single most important number. Always show it.
- "Difficulty: Hard" — the word "hard" is discouraging. "Adventurous" is inviting.

**Good Stats:**
```
Prep: 10 min | Cook: 15 min | Total: 25 min
Servings: 2 | Difficulty: Easy | Cost: $/serving
```

**Bad Stats:**
```
Prep: About 10-15 minutes
Cook: Until done
Servings: 4-6
Difficulty: Intermediate
```
*(Ranges everywhere, "until done" is not a time, "intermediate" is not a tier, no total time.)*

---

## 9. Smart Swap Rules

**Purpose:** Not everyone has every ingredient. Smart Swaps keep the recipe accessible without destroying its character. They're the escape hatch that prevents someone from abandoning the recipe at ingredient 7.

**Format:** Exactly 2-3 swaps. Each follows the pattern: "No [ingredient]? Use [swap] instead."

**Rules:**
- Exactly 2-3 swaps per recipe. Not 1 (feels incomplete). Not 4+ (undermines the recipe's identity — if everything is swappable, nothing matters).
- Swaps must be genuinely useful substitutions. "No truffle oil? Use olive oil instead" works. "No chicken? Use tofu instead" changes the entire dish and should be noted as such.
- The swap must maintain the dish's character. If the dish is "Midnight Quesadilla of Shame," swapping tortillas for lettuce wraps kills the identity.
- Prioritize swapping specialty or less-common ingredients. If the recipe calls for gochujang, that needs a swap. Salt doesn't.
- Each swap is one line. No explanations, no caveats, no "but it won't be quite the same." Just the swap.
- Swaps should be MORE accessible than the original ingredient, not less. Don't swap common for rare.

**Banned swap patterns:**
- "No salt? Use soy sauce" — that changes the dish's flavor profile entirely. Swaps should be lateral moves.
- Swapping a core identity ingredient — if the dish is "Cheesy Budget Rice," you can't swap out cheese.
- "No [ingredient]? Just leave it out" — that's not a swap, that's an omission. Offer an alternative.
- Swaps requiring additional steps — "No breadcrumbs? Toast bread and pulse in food processor" adds complexity. Offer something grab-and-go.
- More than 3 swaps — it starts feeling like the recipe doesn't know what it wants to be.

**Good Smart Swaps:**
```
- No sesame oil? Use olive oil with a pinch of toasted sesame seeds instead.
- No gochujang? Use sriracha mixed with a tsp of honey instead.
- No fresh garlic? Use 1/2 tsp garlic powder instead.
```
*(Common substitutions, maintains character, each is one line, swap is more accessible than original.)*

**Bad Smart Swaps:**
```
- No chicken? Use beef.
- No pan? Use a microwave.
- No salt? Just skip it.
```
*(First one changes the dish. Second one is equipment, not ingredients. Third isn't a substitution.)*

---

## 10. Snap Rules

**Purpose:** The mic-drop. The final line. The thing someone screenshots and sends to their group chat. If the Dish Name hooks them and the recipe feeds them, the Snap is what makes them come back.

**Format:** One or two short sentences.

**Rules:**
- Max 20 words. Sweet spot: 8-15.
- Must be quotable on its own. If someone reads ONLY the Snap, it should be funny, memorable, or make them want to know more.
- Should reference the winning chef, the dish's personality, or the debate's outcome.
- Emotional register: humor, pride, defiance, surprise, satisfaction. Pick one.
- Can break from the instructional tone. This is where the chef's personality gets the last word.
- Never restates the recipe. The Snap is a reaction to the recipe, not a summary of it.

**Banned patterns:**
- "Enjoy your meal!" — generic, dead, the verbal equivalent of a stock photo.
- "Bon appetit!" — we're not a French bistro.
- "And that's how you make [dish]." — dead ending, zero personality.
- "This recipe is great for..." — product description, not a snap.
- "You won't believe how good this is!" — exclamation mark AND presumption. Crimes.
- "Serves best with..." — that's a pairing suggestion, not a snap. Put it in the steps.

**Good Snaps:**
- "Budget King proved you don't need money to eat like royalty. Total cost: $3.40." *(chef reference, specific number, pride)*
- "Maximum Junk has no regrets. Maximum Junk never has regrets." *(character voice, repetition for comedy, unapologetic energy)*
- "Gut Fix wanted to object, but his mouth was full." *(narrative callback, implies even the health chef loved it)*
- "Speed Demon clocked this at 7 minutes. A new personal record." *(time reference, competitive energy, specific number)*
- "Five ingredients. One pan. Zero shame." *(rule of three, escalating simplicity, defiant tone)*

**Bad Snaps:**
- "Enjoy your meal!" *(nothing. Empty. A cafeteria sign.)*
- "And that's dinner sorted." *(flat, no personality, no chef voice)*
- "This pairs well with a side salad and some crusty bread." *(recipe suggestion, not a snap. Wrong section.)*
- "We hope you liked this recipe!" *(who is "we"? This isn't a newsletter.)*

---

## 11. Tone Rules

**The voice:** Five opinionated chefs arguing in a kitchen at midnight. Irreverent, funny, food-obsessed, occasionally chaotic, always authentic. The recipe is the result of that argument — it should read like a love letter written by committee.

**DO:**
- Use contractions. Always. "It's", "you're", "don't", "can't", "won't."
- Let chef personalities bleed through. A recipe championed by Maximum Junk should feel indulgent in its language. A Speed Demon recipe should feel rushed and efficient.
- Be direct. "Sear the chicken" not "You may want to consider searing the chicken."
- Use food-specific sensory language. "Until the edges crisp" paints a picture. "Until cooked" doesn't.
- Be funny when it serves the recipe. Humor in the Dish Name, Tagline, Debate Summary, and Snap is expected. Humor in the Steps is welcome if it doesn't obscure the instruction.
- Write like someone who genuinely loves food and finds the chaos of cooking entertaining.
- Reference the debate. The recipe has a story. Let that story breathe through the tone.

**DON'T:**
- Use exclamation marks. They try too hard. The humor should come from the words, not the punctuation. (Exception: inside a direct chef quote if it fits their personality — and even then, sparingly.)
- Be pretentious. No "a delicate interplay of umami and acid." Say "the soy sauce and lime hit different together."
- Be health-preachy. Gut Fix can advocate for gut health, but the overall tone should never lecture. "This has probiotics" is fine. "You really should eat more fermented foods for your microbiome" is a TED talk.
- Write food blog preamble. No "Growing up, my mother used to make this every Sunday..." The recipe starts at the Dish Name. Period.
- Use "foodie" vocabulary. No "elevated", "curated", "artisanal", "farm-to-table", "drizzle" (as a noun). These words have been strip-mined of meaning.
- Be boring. If a sentence could appear in any recipe from any source, it's too generic for ForkIt.
- Use passive voice. "The onions are sauteed" is dead. "Saute the onions" is alive.
- Hedge. "This might work well" is weak. "This works" is ForkIt.

**Banned words and phrases:**
- "Elevated" — banned forever.
- "Curated" — this isn't a museum.
- "Artisanal" — instant pretension.
- "Farm-to-table" — meaningless.
- "Drizzle" as a noun ("a drizzle of...") — overused into oblivion. As a verb ("drizzle olive oil") it's fine.
- "Mouthfeel" — no.
- "Yummy" — we're not five years old.
- "Delish" — abbreviated cringe.
- "Nom nom" — absolutely not.
- "Guilt-free" — food shouldn't require moral justification.
- "Superfood" — marketing, not cooking.
- "Clean eating" — implies other food is dirty.

**Chef-specific voice rules:**

**Max Flavour:**
- Vocabulary: "blast", "fire", "bold", "hit", "layers", "depth", "sear", "caramelize"
- Energy: aggressive confidence. Treats every dish like a championship bout.
- Example line: "If it doesn't have at least three layers of flavor, what's the point?"

**Maximum Junk:**
- Vocabulary: "cheese", "loaded", "extra", "full send", "no regrets", "double down"
- Energy: gleeful, unapologetic indulgence. Treats calories like a scoreboard.
- Example line: "Cheese on cheese is not a mistake. It's a philosophy."

**Gut Fix:**
- Vocabulary: "fermented", "probiotic", "balance", "gut", "nourish", "culture" (bacterial, not societal)
- Energy: gentle but firm. The health-conscious friend who somehow makes it charming.
- Example line: "Your gut has opinions. This recipe respects them."

**Budget King:**
- Vocabulary: dollar amounts, "value", "stretch", "pantry", "staple", "under $X"
- Energy: practical pride. Treats frugality like a superpower.
- Example line: "Total cost: $2.80. Your wallet just said thank you."

**Speed Demon:**
- Vocabulary: time references, "minutes", "clock", "fast", "done", "next"
- Energy: impatient efficiency. Hates anything that takes longer than it should.
- Example line: "If your recipe needs a timer, it's already too long."

## 12. Technical Compatibility Rules

ForkIt recipes display on mobile cards, in share previews, and in push notifications. Content must render cleanly across all these surfaces.

- **Dish Name must fit on one line at 375px width.** Max 6 words enforces this. Test with a long word like "Mediterranean" — if it wraps, shorten.
- **Tagline must fit in a share preview.** Social cards truncate at roughly 80 characters. A 15-word tagline in short words stays under this.
- **Ingredient lines must be scannable.** One ingredient per line. No inline paragraphs of ingredients. No "and also add" connectors.
- **Steps must be parseable as a numbered list.** The UI renders steps as numbered cards. Each step must be self-contained — no "continuing from step 3" references.
- **Stats must be machine-readable.** Use exact formats: "10 min" not "about ten minutes." The UI parses these values for filtering and sorting.
- **No emoji in Dish Names or Taglines.** Emoji render inconsistently across platforms and break accessibility tools. Emoji in Debate Summaries and Snaps are tolerated but discouraged.
- **No special Unicode characters.** Degree symbols (350F not 350°F to avoid encoding issues), fractions as decimals (0.5 cup not 1/2 cup), standard ASCII quotes.
- **Smart Swaps must follow exact format.** "No [X]? Use [Y] instead." The UI may parse this pattern for interactive swap buttons.

---

## 13. Additional Accessibility Rules

Recipes must be usable by everyone, regardless of cooking skill, kitchen setup, or dietary knowledge.

- **Assume a basic kitchen.** Stove, oven, one pan, one pot, a knife, a cutting board. If the recipe needs a blender, stand mixer, or sous vide, note it in the Stats as equipment.
- **Use common ingredient names.** "Cilantro" not "coriander leaf." "Green onion" not "scallion" (or note both). Use the name most people search for at the grocery store.
- **Include temperatures in Fahrenheit with Celsius in parentheses.** "Preheat to 400F (200C)." Most ForkIt users are US-based, but the app is global.
- **No assumed knowledge.** "Dice the onion" is fine — most people know what dicing means. "Chiffonade the basil" is not fine — say "slice the basil into thin ribbons."
- **Allergen-relevant ingredients should appear in Smart Swaps when possible.** If the recipe uses soy sauce, a swap for coconut aminos acknowledges soy allergies.
- **Serving sizes should be realistic.** "Serves 2" means two actual humans eating a satisfying meal, not two decorative portions on oversized plates.

## 14. One Dish, Always

**Every ForkIt recipe is exactly one dish.** This is non-negotiable.

- A recipe produces one thing you eat. Not a main and two sides. Not a "meal prep for the week." One dish.
- If a dish needs a sauce, the sauce is part of the recipe, not a separate recipe.
- "Tacos with homemade salsa and guacamole" is three recipes pretending to be one. Pick one: the tacos (with store-bought salsa), or the salsa, or the guacamole.
- The test: can you describe what this recipe makes in 3 words or fewer? "Fried rice." "Loaded nachos." "Breakfast quesadilla." If you need a comma, it might be two dishes.
- Exception: if a sauce or topping takes less than 2 ingredients and 1 step, it can be folded into the main recipe. A squeeze of lime on tacos isn't a separate recipe.

## 15. What a ForkIt Recipe Is NOT

A ForkIt recipe is NOT:

- **A real recipe from a cookbook.** Every recipe is AI-invented by the chef council. It's original. It may be inspired by classics, but it's never a copy.
- **A health lecture disguised as food.** Even Gut Fix's recipes should taste good first, be healthy second. No ingredient exists solely for its nutritional value.
- **A food blog post.** No life stories, no "I first discovered this on a trip to Tuscany," no 800 words before the recipe. The recipe IS the content.
- **A restaurant menu description.** No "pan-seared Atlantic salmon on a bed of wilted greens with a balsamic reduction." Describe what to DO, not what it looks like on a plate.
- **A boring meal plan.** ForkIt recipes have personality. If the recipe could appear in any meal-planning app without modification, it's too generic.
- **A random combination of ingredients.** The dish must actually taste good. "Peanut butter and pickle stir-fry" is random. "Peanut butter noodles with pickled vegetables" is a real dish. The chefs debate, but they're not stupid.
- **A recipe for a crowd.** Max 4 servings. This is "what do I eat tonight," not "what do I bring to the potluck."
- **An ingredients advertisement.** No brand names, no product placements, no "use [Brand] for best results."
- **Aspirational content.** If the average person can't make this with what's at their grocery store and in their kitchen, it doesn't belong on ForkIt.
- **A copy of something you'd find by Googling.** If the recipe already exists identically on AllRecipes, it has no reason to exist on ForkIt. The dish name, the chef debate, the personality — these make it original.

### Gold Standard #1: "Midnight Quesadilla of Shame"

**Dish Name:** Midnight Quesadilla of Shame

**Tagline:** Maximum Junk built this at 1 AM and called it fine dining.

**Debate Summary:** Maximum Junk wanted a grilled cheese. Budget King said that's just bread and cheese. They compromised: a quesadilla loaded with whatever's left in the fridge. Gut Fix added pickled jalapenos and called it "fermented."

**Ingredients:**
- 2 large flour tortillas
- 1.5 cups shredded cheddar cheese
- 4 slices deli turkey, torn into pieces
- 2 tbsp pickled jalapenos, chopped
- 2 tbsp butter
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tbsp hot sauce

**Steps:**
1. Melt 1 tbsp butter in a large pan over medium heat.
2. Lay one tortilla flat, cover with cheese, turkey, jalapenos, and garlic powder.
3. Top with second tortilla and press down firmly.
4. Cook 3 minutes until the bottom is golden and crispy.
5. Flip carefully, add remaining butter to the pan, cook 3 more minutes.
6. Slide onto a cutting board, hit it with hot sauce, slice into quarters.

**Stats:**
```
Prep: 5 min | Cook: 6 min | Total: 11 min
Servings: 1 | Difficulty: Easy | Cost: $/serving
```

**Smart Swaps:**
- No cheddar? Use any melting cheese — mozzarella, pepper jack, even cream cheese in a pinch.
- No deli turkey? Use leftover chicken, ham, or skip the meat entirely.
- No pickled jalapenos? Use a few dashes of hot sauce mixed into the cheese layer.

**Snap:** Maximum Junk called this "a lifestyle." Budget King called it "$1.85."

#### Expert Commentary: Why This Works

**Dish Name:** "Midnight Quesadilla of Shame" is 4 words, instantly paints a picture, and makes you laugh. You've been there. You know this quesadilla. The word "shame" does all the heavy lifting — it implies indulgence, late-night decisions, and zero regret, all in one word.

**Tagline:** Names the chef, establishes the time (1 AM), and the phrase "called it fine dining" is the exact kind of delusional confidence Maximum Junk embodies. 13 words. No wasted space.

**Debate Summary:** Three chefs, three distinct positions. Maximum Junk wants indulgence. Budget King applies practical criticism ("that's just bread and cheese" — funny because it's true). The compromise is specific and logical. Gut Fix's contribution is the punchline — calling pickled jalapenos "fermented" is perfectly in character. 44 words.

**Ingredients:** 7 items. Every one has a quantity and unit. "Torn into pieces" and "chopped" are inline prep instructions. No brand names. Everything is available at any grocery store. Ordered by use.

**Steps:** 6 steps. Longest step is 14 words. Every step is one action. Sensory cues: "golden and crispy." Time estimates: "3 minutes," "3 more minutes." Final step includes personality ("hit it with hot sauce"). Imperative mood throughout.

**Stats:** All 6 fields present. 5 + 6 = 11. Math checks out. Servings: 1 (this is a solo midnight mission). Easy difficulty (correct — it's a quesadilla). $ cost (correct — it's mostly cheese and tortillas).

**Smart Swaps:** Exactly 3. Each follows the format. Each is genuinely useful. The cheese swap acknowledges reality (most people have SOME cheese). The meat swap includes a skip option. The jalapeno swap maintains the heat profile.

**Snap:** References two chefs with contrasting reactions. The specific dollar amount ($1.85) is a Budget King signature. The contrast between "a lifestyle" and a price tag is the joke. 12 words.

### Gold Standard #2: "Emergency Fried Rice Protocol"

**Dish Name:** Emergency Fried Rice Protocol

**Tagline:** Speed Demon clocked this at 12 minutes and still had time to gloat.

**Debate Summary:** Speed Demon demanded under 15 minutes. Max Flavour insisted on a proper sear. Budget King vetoed anything over $4. The result: high-heat fried rice using yesterday's leftovers. Gut Fix stayed silent, which counts as approval.

**Ingredients:**
- 3 cups cooked rice, day-old and cold
- 2 eggs, beaten
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp sesame oil
- 1 cup frozen peas and carrots
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 green onions, sliced
- 1 tsp chili flakes
- 1 tbsp vegetable oil

**Steps:**
1. Heat vegetable oil in a large pan or wok over high heat until smoking.
2. Add beaten eggs, scramble hard for 30 seconds, break into small pieces.
3. Push eggs to the side, add garlic, cook 30 seconds until fragrant.
4. Add cold rice, press flat against the pan, let it sear 2 minutes without stirring.
5. Toss rice, add frozen veggies and soy sauce, stir-fry 3 minutes.
6. Kill the heat, add sesame oil, chili flakes, and green onions.
7. Serve immediately. Speed Demon is already eating.

**Stats:**
```
Prep: 5 min | Cook: 7 min | Total: 12 min
Servings: 2 | Difficulty: Easy | Cost: $/serving
```

**Smart Swaps:**
- No sesame oil? Use a drizzle of olive oil plus a pinch of toasted sesame seeds.
- No day-old rice? Spread fresh rice on a sheet pan and refrigerate 30 minutes.
- No frozen veggies? Use any leftover vegetables, chopped small.

**Snap:** Twelve minutes from fridge to plate. Speed Demon didn't even sit down.

#### Expert Commentary: Why This Works

**Dish Name:** "Emergency Fried Rice Protocol" is 4 words. "Emergency" sets the urgency. "Protocol" elevates a simple dish to a mission briefing. It's funny because it takes fried rice — the most casual food on earth — and treats it like a military operation. That's the Speed Demon energy.

**Tagline:** Names the chef, includes a specific time (12 minutes), and "still had time to gloat" captures Speed Demon's competitive personality. The tagline tells you everything: this is fast, and the chef is proud of it. 14 words.

**Debate Summary:** Four chefs, each with a specific demand. Speed Demon's time constraint, Max Flavour's quality standard, Budget King's budget cap. The compromise is logical: fried rice is fast, flavorful, and cheap. Gut Fix's silence as approval is the comedic beat — it says more than a contribution would. 42 words.

**Ingredients:** 9 items. All with quantities. "Day-old and cold" is critical technique info delivered inline. "Beaten" tells you to prep the eggs before you start. Ordered by use. Every item is a grocery store staple.

**Steps:** 7 steps. The longest is 16 words. Step 4 is the key technique moment — "press flat, let it sear, don't stir" is real wok cooking advice delivered simply. Sensory cues: "until smoking," "until fragrant." Time estimates throughout. The final step is a chef personality callback that doubles as a real instruction (serve immediately — fried rice dies if it sits).

**Stats:** 5 + 7 = 12. Correct. Servings: 2 (fried rice is naturally a 2-serving recipe at this volume). Easy (correct — it's stir-frying in one pan). $ cost (rice, eggs, and frozen veggies — this is Budget King territory).

**Smart Swaps:** Exactly 3. The sesame oil swap is practical (not everyone has it). The day-old rice swap is the most useful — it solves the biggest obstacle to making fried rice on impulse. The veggie swap is flexible without being vague ("any leftover vegetables, chopped small" — specific enough to act on).

**Snap:** "Twelve minutes from fridge to plate" is a Speed Demon time flex. "Didn't even sit down" is the perfect character detail — it implies standing over the stove, eating from the pan. 12 words. Quotable. You can hear Speed Demon's voice.

*These rules are the style guide. Every AI generation prompt, every content review, every quality check uses this document as the standard. When in doubt, read the recipe out loud. If it sounds like something a food blog would publish unchanged, it's too boring. If it sounds like five opinionated chefs wrote it at midnight — controlled chaos that produces something delicious — it's ForkIt.*
